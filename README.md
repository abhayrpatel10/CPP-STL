##C++ STL

This is a Simple guide to STL(Standard Template Library in C++)

#STL is composed of
#1)Containers
#2)Algorithms
#3)Iterators

#C++ - STL Conatiners
Containers in STL provide an easy and fast way to implement data Structures like arrays,Linked list,Stack,etc.
The containers are generic and can hold data of any type.
Eg vector,stack,Queue

#C++ -STL Algorithms
STL provides a number of algorithms that can be used on the containers irrespective of their type.They provide Abstraction.
Eg reverse(),sort()

#C++ - STL Iterators
Iterators in STL are used to point to the containers.They act as bridge between Containers and Algorithms.
